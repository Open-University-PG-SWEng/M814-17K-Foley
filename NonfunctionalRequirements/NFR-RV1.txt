[BM] The description of the non-functional requirement looks okay to me. I think asserting the method used for payment will be 100% secure and private cannot really be achieved because not all threats are known. I suggest it may be more appropriate to remove the ‘100%’ from the fit criteria. Also, add to the fit criteria that the method used for payment is secure and private for known threats.
