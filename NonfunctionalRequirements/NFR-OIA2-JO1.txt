The fit criteria is ambiguous and it is not clear what the benchmark is. Due to its ambiguity, it cannot be used as an input when designing acceptance tests and it will fail the quality gateway.  

Based on my understanding of the requirement, you want to ensure that cleaning schedule details are accurately captured to enable the assignment of those duties to maintenance workers. Try using a quantity to set a benchmark like “98 percent of schedule details contain x y z, where for example x is the address of the property to be maintained”
