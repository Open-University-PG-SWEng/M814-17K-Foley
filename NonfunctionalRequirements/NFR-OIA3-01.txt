[HE] The use of quantifiable properties in the fit criteria are commendable. However, the fit criteria are ambiguous. What happens if the weekly schedule of the property is generated in 6 minutes? Is it acceptable? Given that it is above 5 minutes, it is still below 7 minutes. 

Can you modify the fit criteria to make it unambiguous? For example, if the generation of the schedule should occur in less than 5 minutes 98% of the time, what is the repercussion of it being generated between 5 and 7 minutes. This fit criteria does not currently pass the quality gateway. 
[DG] I think this requirement is a sound NFR proposal, and the general gist of the fit criterion is correct in that it focuses on getting them from the rationale and makes sure that they are testable, however I do think that five minutes is far too long, and 7 minutes excessive, there may be some ambiguity. Perhaps something more along the lines of "etc. etc, will be produced within 2 minutes maximum of the request?
