[MP] - Clear, precise, non-ambiguous and to the point. This non-functional requirement is well written and a has testable fit criterion. 
       However, I have doubts after reading the law 3.22 about how the requirement would be fully testable. How would a tester decide that the availability or 
       amount of benefits are exaggerated? Unfortunately, I cannot read the whole document. Does the document anywhere sepcify that the price claims will be 
       termed as exaggerated if the availability or amount of benefits are less than a certain amount of claimed benefits value? If yes, then it can also be 
       mentioned in the fit criteria. If no, then is it possible to mention quantifiable criteria on the price claims that will be termed as exaggerated?  

[JO] It would appear that you have given a comprehensive NFR for, government imposing, marketing and advertising laws on rental properties and the fit criterion can be tested against the benchmarks stated. But having looked at 3.20 'Marketing communications that state prices must also state applicable delivery, freight or postal charges or, if those cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, state that such charges are payable.' I don't see how that is applicable to rental prices.
