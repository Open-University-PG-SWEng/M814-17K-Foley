[BM] The description of the non-functional requirement looks okay to me. I think the capacity of storing the details of one million holidaymakers seems high enough. I think for the fit criteria though further details could be required for holidays, such as a home address and alternative contact number. Also, the number of characters required for some of the values seem low, for example a double-barrelled surname may exceed more than 15 characters.
