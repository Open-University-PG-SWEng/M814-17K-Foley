[RV] it does sound as functional requirement to me as you say - "The product shall be able to display", I think it may have duplication issue with HE3 itself when implemented. Your Fit criterion depends a lot on machine holiday maker is using for access to the product, or speed of connection he may have. I think we have to measure product performance, but not holiday maker equipment abilities.
