Description: The product shall be able to display the list of available holiday properties to a holidaymaker within a reasonable timeframe.

[RV] it does sound as functional requirement to me as you say - "The product shall be able to display", I think it may have duplication issue with HE3 itself when implemented. Your Fit criterion depends a lot on machine holiday maker is using for access to the product, or speed of connection he may have. I think we have to measure product performance, but not holiday maker equipment abilities.
[SR] to me it looks like a nonfunctional requirement similar to the first example of MRP page 247. even so, I do think that 60 seconds is a little too long. in my opinion, 1 to 3 seconds should be appropriate.
[JO] I believe the above is a Non-functional Requirement . I think the Fit Criterion should read: 'The list of available properties will be displayed to a holidaymaker, after entering location, should be between 1-5 seconds'. 60 seconds is a little too long to wait for a response. You can't factor in someone's connection speed - you must work to an average speed.
[BM] Based on the comments received I have updated the fit criteria by decreasing the time allowed for the list of available holiday properties and updated the wording.
