[RV] I think - The booking confirmation shall clearly state the booking details. As "display" may be part of solution - to display it on screen, but this confirmation can be stated using email, phone message, phone call or by other means. For Fit criteria you used users ability to locate details, but diferent Holidaymakers abilities is difers. I think Fit criteria would be - All users must receive booking confirmation, by at least one method.

[MP] - I think the fit criterion can be made more precise. As everyone's speed of reading and locating the required information may differ, 
       it would make more sense to include a certain percentage of people who would be able to locate the details within 5 seconds.

[DG] - edited fit criterion after feedback to allow for different abilities of users
