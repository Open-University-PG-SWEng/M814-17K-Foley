Fit Criterion: Holidaymakers must be able to locate details that are requested within five seconds.
Originator: Derived from functional requirement AB5

[RV] I think - The booking confirmation shall clearly state the booking details. As "display" may be part of solution - to display it on screen, but this confirmation can be stated using email, phone message, phone call or by other means. For Fit criteria you used users ability to locate details, but diferent Holidaymakers abilities is difers. I think Fit criteria would be - All users must receive booking confirmation, by at least one method.

[MP] - I think the fit criterion can be made more precise. As everyone's speed of reading and locating the required information may differ, 
       it would make more sense to include a certain percentage of people who would be able to locate the details within 5 seconds.

[DG] - edited fit criterion after feedback to allow for different abilities of users

[DT] Apologies for the delay in commenting. The description of this non-functional requirement is correct and the rationale makes it easy for the reader to understand the reason of this requirement. However I think the fit criterion should be more accurate. As the fit criterion serves as a benchmark for testing, it should, probably, include a bit more detail as to what the tester(s) should look for. For example: Reservation dates, cost etc. Finally, regarding, the type of this requirement, I am not sure whether this is a type 10 (Look and feel requirement) or type 11 (usability and humanity), as it can be considered a valid usability point (easily locating details).
