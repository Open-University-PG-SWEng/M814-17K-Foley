REQ-ID: SR-HE1
Description: The product shall have a capacity of storing at least 1M holidaymaker details.
Type: performance requirement
Rationale: 1M is the maximum number of potential customers for the product.
Fit Criterion: the storage size assigned for storing holidaymaker details should be at least 860MB.
The calculation of the space is based on 4 bytes per character for the details below: first name- maximum 15 characters, last name- maximum 25 characters, home address- 110 characters, email address- maximum 40 characters, phone number- maximum 10 characters and alternative contact number 10 characters.

[BM] The description of the non-functional requirement looks okay to me. I think the capacity of storing the details of one million holidaymakers seems high enough. I think for the fit criteria though further details could be required for holidays, such as a home address and alternative contact number. Also, the number of characters required for some of the values seem low, for example a double-barrelled surname may exceed more than 15 characters.
[DG] 1m actually seems low to me given that some people, especially older people, may have duplicate accounts because of mistakes. I would suggest saying "at least 1M", that way future storage increases aren't capped. 940mb could also be low if profile photos are uploaded for example? I would err on the higher side, space is cheap now. I concur with BM tha some of the character allowances are a little short, what about international customers, particularly for the contact numbers? (would international prefixes be in a separate storage space?)
[DT] Many apologies for the delay in commenting this requirement. Aside the fact, that I, too, think that 1M holiday makers is a bit low, and that a limit of 40 characters on the email will cause problems, I am not sure about the fit criterion, as the benchmark should be something the testers can easily determine and it would appear that determining the maximum size for a single holiday maker would make more sense. Regarding the rationale of this requirement, It doesn't look as it justifies the reason for the requirement and looks more like a paraphrase of the description.
